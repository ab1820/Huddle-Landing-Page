## Overview
My 3rd Frontend Mentor Challenge, this time I am building a landing page. This will be the first landing page that I have built.
Built with mobile design first in mind. 
I like to finish the mobile version first, then I set the media to min-width: 800px, and design the desktop version from that. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


### Continued development
Web design will always be continued learning. As the years pass and technology grows, things will change for the markup language and web styling, that's why I will always be learning.
But for now, mobile first, responsiveness, CSS Grid and Flexbox are what I am currently working on right now.
